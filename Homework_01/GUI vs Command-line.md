GUI vs. Command-Line Interface
Graphic user interface is the interface that I've been using my whole life. Everything is visible on my desktop, and I click on actual icons of folders to go to a folder, or icons of different programs. I can also go to Finder and go through things that way.
Command Line Interface is a way to see everything in a text-only manner. Instead of right-clicking to perform actions on folders, I can type in actions and also manage severel files on the same screen.
The advantage to GUI is that it is a lot more intuitive and visual. I can take steps that are written out for me and figure out actions from a list. 
The advantage of learning Command Line is that it ends up being faster as well as giving me more options to manipulate the content on my computer. 
While it is nice to continue to use GUI, I think it would be best to learn a more efficient way to use my computer.
