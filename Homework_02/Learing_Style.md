Learning Style
My learning style was 25% auditory, 40% visual, and 35% tactile. I don't know about what the discription said. It described me as "usually neat and clean." I couldn't think of any statement that would miss the mark more. It was right about "you may have difficulty with spoken directions." I can't remember the first turn after someone tells me where to drive. I've started to color code a few years ago; that was on the list of tips. It helps me a ton. Overall, I think a lot of this depends on what I'm doing. I think what will help me with coding is to run my code as often as possible. That will have the visual aspects covered. I also think tinkering around will tap into the tactile aspects. I'm terrible at listening to lectures, which is part of why I'm an online student, so I don't have to worry about that! Overall, this was mostly accurate. I'll take the "drawing pictures" tip into account. I know a lot of desigers and media artists recommend working with pencil and paper first. Even though it seems like an extra step, I think it could be really helpful.
