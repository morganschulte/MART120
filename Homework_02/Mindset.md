Mindset
I took the same quiz last year and after a year of working on things and the help of others, I made it into the growth mindset catagory! I made it in by one point, but what do you call the graduate with the lowest grades in med school? "Doctor." It is a little bit hard to imagine everyone having the ability to change. This world has some scary people that have done bad things to me and loved ones. I think that its sometimes dangerous to be too optimistic. I do think that where that optimism is important is when I'm looking at myself. I'm a good person. I can grow. I can learn. I've taken steps to make routines. I started gardening and now I'm drowning in tomatoes. I'm learning more about animation and I think I'm going to be really good at it. Programming is where I have struggled, and where I will struggle, but I don't plan on stopping this time. I always get annoyed when people say "I just wasn't born with the art gene" as if I haven't spent hours upon hours working on my craft. Nobody was born to code either, and I have to remember that. I'm going to do badly and then ok and then eventually, I'll be able to look back at my old sequences like old sketch books and be thankful I took the time to struggle. At that point, I'll be struggling more efficiently and be proud of where I came from and proud of where I'm at.
